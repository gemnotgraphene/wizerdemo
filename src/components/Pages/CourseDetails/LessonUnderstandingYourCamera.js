        Understanding your camera is essential for capturing high-quality photos. Cameras come in various types, including DSLRs, mirrorless, and smartphone cameras, each offering unique features. Key parts of a camera include the lens, which focuses light onto the sensor; the viewfinder, for composing shots; the shutter button; and the mode dial for adjusting settings. Proper handling improves stabilityâ€”use both hands, keep elbows close, and utilize a neck strap to avoid drops. Learning these basics, such as types, parts, and handling techniques, enables better control over your device and enhances your photography skills from the very start.
