        The Learn Photography Course offers a foundational, two-week introduction to essential photography concepts. In Week 1, students explore the basics of handling a camera, the exposure triangle (aperture, shutter speed, ISO), and how these settings impact image quality. Through daily quizzes and a practical assignment, students gain hands-on experience with adjusting exposure to capture their desired results.

        Week 2 focuses on composition and lighting, crucial for creating visually appealing photos. Topics include the rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, and using natural and artificial light effectively. Students learn about golden and blue hours, as well as using shadows and contrast to add depth to their images. By the end of the course, students complete practical assignments and quizzes, applying what they’ve learned to capture well-composed and well-lit photos. This beginner-friendly course provides a solid foundation, preparing students for more advanced photography skills.
